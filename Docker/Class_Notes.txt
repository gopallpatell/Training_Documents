	Containerization using Docker!
	
	Docker!!!
	
	Containerization :::
	
		--> Containerization is a process of packaging the application along with its dependencies!
	
	
	
	Virtual Machines :
	
		- VMs are hardware level Virtualization 
		- VMs are created using Hypervisor 
		- VMs are used to run the Operating Systems
		- VMs will continue to execute even if there is no task or active applications
		- VMs consume more space and time to start up.
		
	Containers :
	
		- Containers are hardware level Virtualization 
		- Containers are created using Container Engine 
		- Containers are used to run the the Application. NOT Operating Systems
		- Containers will immediately go to EXIT state, if there is no task or active applications
		- Containers consume less space and time to start up
		- Using Containers we can reduce the no. of VM, But we cannot completely elimate VMs
		- Container run in its own isolated address spac, the scope of the container application is within the container 
	
	
		--> Containerization is a process of packaging the application along with its dependencies!	

	Container Use-Cases :::
		
	Infra-Structure Perspective :::	
	
		--> Containers are used to reduce the number of VMs and save the Infra-Structure Cost!
		
			Jenkins_Master (VM)			==> To Create Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Projects and schedule to the builds in the slave_nodes
																	
				Jenkins_SlaveNode1 (VM)	==> Perform Application Builds - Java Applications 
				Jenkins_SlaveNode2 (VM)	==> Perform Application Builds - .Net Applications			
				Jenkins_SlaveNode3 (VM)	==> Perform Application Builds - Python Applications 
				Jenkins_SlaveNode4 (VM)	==> Perform Application Builds - Angular/NodeJS
				Jenkins_SlaveNode5 (VM)	==> Perform Application Builds - Ruby 
		
		--> Using Containers :
		
			Jenkins_Master (VM)	
				- Jenkins_Build_Server (VM)
					- Install Container Engine  
						C1			==> Perform Application Builds - Java Applications 
						C2          ==> Perform Application Builds - .Net Applications	
						C3          ==> Perform Application Builds - Python Applications
						C4          ==> Perform Application Builds - Angular/NodeJS
						C5          ==> Perform Application Builds - Ruby 
		
	Developers'/Deployment Perspective ::: 
	
		--> Containers are used to package the application along with its dependencies and deploy in target environments!	


		Environments:
		
			Dev Environment (VM)
			
				Developers Create the Source Code 
					Build - Compile and Create Artifacts 				==>	mywebapp.war 
					Run the Application and do Unit Testing 
						--> jdk_11,tomcat_8.0 	- using this jdk and tomcat mywebapp.war got executed and tested
					Promote the Application to QA / UAT / Prod 
					
			QA Environment 	(VM)										==> mywebapp.war
				Testing Team will Run the Application and do QA Testing 
						--> jdk_17,tomcat_9.0
				
			UAT Environment 
				Testing Team will Run the Application and do QA Testing 
			


		--> Using Containerization Process :::
			
		--> Containerization is a process of packaging the application along with its dependencies!	
			Using Containerization ::::
			
			
			Dev Environment (VM)
			
				Developers Create the Source Code 
					Build - Compile and Create Artifacts 				==>	mywebapp.war 
					Run the Application and do Unit Testing 
						--> jdk_11,tomcat_8.0 	- using this jdk and tomcat mywebapp.war got executed and tested
						
					Package the application - (mywebapp.war + jkd_11,tomcat_8.0)	--> Application Images 	
					
					Create Application Image --> mywebapp_imgv1.0
					
					Publish/Push/Save the Application Image to the Container Registry and version control it.
						
						
			QA Environment 	(VM)								
				Testing Team will Pull the Application Image from Container Registry and run it as an Application Container.
					==> mywebapp_imgv1.0		--> (mywebapp.war + jkd_11,tomcat_8.0)
			
			
	Terminolgies :::
	
		Container Engine 
			-- Is used to Create/Manage Container Images and Create/Manage and run Containers	
		
		Container Images 
			--	Is a Static file that defined the properties of the Container and its dependencies 
			--  Container Images are Non-Executables
			--  Container Images are composed of various Layers created using the Dockerfile Instructions
			
		Containers 
			--	Containers are the executable units of Container Images
			-- 	Containers are used to run the applications defined in the Container Images 		
		
		Container Registry 
			--	It is used to save and version control the Container Images 
				Dockerhub is Container Registry to be used.
				https://hub.docker.com/			
		
		Container Repositories
			--	Container Repositories	are the subset of Container Registry
			
			github 			Docker-Hub_Registry
				repo1			Docker-hub_Repository1
				repo2			Docker-hub_Repository2
			
			
	Working with Docker!
	
		- Install Docker Engine 
			# https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
			
			- Launch Ubuntu Machine - v22.04 / Use existing Jenkins Slave Node to Installl Docker Engine
			
			- sudo -i 
			- apt update -y 			
			- apt install docker.io -y
		
		
		- Docker CLI Commands
		
		docker --version
		
		
		docker images 			# To get the list of images in local machine 
		
		docker ps 				# To get the list of Active/Running Containers 
		
		docker ps -a			# To get the list of all containers
		
		
		Container Registry 
			--	It is used to save and version control the Container Images 
				Dockerhub is Container Registry to be used.
				https://hub.docker.com/			
		
		Container Repositories
			--	Container Repositories	are the subset of Container Registry



		docker pull <Image_Name>	# To download the docker container image from dockerhub registry to lacl machine 
		
			docker pull centos:latest
			docker pull ubuntu:v1.0

	docker pull <Image_Name> 				# TO Download the latest version of Container Image 
	
	docker pull <Image_Name>:<tag>			# TO Download the specific version of Container Image 
	
	
	docker run <Image_Name>					# To Create and run the Container 
	
	Container Execution Modes ::
	
		- Foreground / Attached Mode 		# Default Mode 
		
				docker run <image_name> 
				
				Eg.: 
				
					docker run centos sleep 20 
		
		- Background / Detached Mode 
			
				docker run -d <image_name> 
				Eg.: 
				
					docker run -d centos sleep 20 	
		
		- Interactive Mode 
		
				docker run -d <image_name> 
				Eg.: 
				
					docker run -it centos bash 			

	
	docker start <container_id>						# To Start the Container 
	
	docker stop <container_id>						# To Stop the container 
	
	docker exec -it <container_id> bash 			# To Login to the running Container 
	
	docker rm <container_id>						# To remove/delete the Container 
	
	docker rmi <image_name>							# To remove/delete the Image from local machine
	
	
	Port Mapping / Port Binding ::::
	
		- It is used to expose the container to access thru internet 
		
		- It is a process of mapping the container port with the host port.
	
	Run Application inside the Container!
	
		docker run -it tomcat:8.0 bash
		
		docker run -it -p <host_Port>:<container_Port> tomcat:8.0
		
		Eg:
		
		docker run -it -p 8089:8080 tomcat:8.0
	
		-p <host_Port>:<container_Port>
		
		
	QA_Server :::
	
		Installed Tomcat ::
		
		8080 --> Execute only one application 
		
		service1 -- 8080
		
		service2 -- 8089
